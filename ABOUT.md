My thought process as I built the application: 

I used external interrupt and connected with button to open or close led.
For showing a temperature sensor reading in determined time ,every 3 second, I used timer interrupt.
So in my project i just used interrupts to give it ability to act in determined time of pressing button or showing temperature.

my experience :

I got course in Embedded system in Amit learning
I got course in microship in Jelecom

I have good knowledge about AVR and PIC microcontroller and its Peripheral.

I made some projects in this field Like

1.Smart home.
2.Flight controller (PID control).
3.Sun tracking.
4.Automotive wireless control.
